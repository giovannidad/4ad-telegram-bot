Bring me his head! The creature asks the party to kill a boss monster.
Roll on the boss table to determine who. The next time the party meets a boss in a room, instead of rolling it up, you may use the boss from the
quest. Killing the boss and bringing its head to the creatureâ€™s room completes the quest.
