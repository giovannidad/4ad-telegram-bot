Invisible Gremlins. A band of invisible gremlins steal d6+3 objects from the party. You must surrender objects from any of your characters in this order of preference: magic items, scrolls, potions, weapons, gems, coins (in bundles of 10 gp each). If the gremlins steal ALL of your equipment, they will leave a thank you message that counts as a clue. The gremlins have no combat stats because it is impossible to fight them. Encountering them gives no XP roll
