Iron Eater. Level 3, 4 life, 3 attacks, no treasure. Defense rolls against the iron eater do not enjoy bonus from heavy armor (shield and light armor count). If the monster hits, the character takes no damage but loses his armor, shield, main weapon, or 3d6 gp, in this order.

Reactions (d6): 1 flee, 2-3 bribe (d6 gp to distract the creature; you may not fool the creature with fools gold), 4-6 fight.
