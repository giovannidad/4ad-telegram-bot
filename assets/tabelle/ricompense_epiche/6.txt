Holy symbol of healing. The party is given a holy symbol that may be used only by a cleric. The cleric will make all healing rolls at +2 until he dies. When the cleric dies, the holy symbol can be bought to the clericâ€™s church. If the symbol and the body of the slain cleric are delivered to the church, an attempt to resurrect that cleric will be paid by the church. If unused, the holy symbol can be sold for 700 gold pieces.
