Shield of Warning. One of the partyâ€™s shields is now enchanted and counts as protection even if the user is surprised by wandering monsters or if the party is fleeing from a combat. If the party has no shields, they will be given one. The shield of warning is permanent, and will last throughout a campaign. It can be sold for 200 gold pieces.
