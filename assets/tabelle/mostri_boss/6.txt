Small Dragon. Level 6, 5 life points, 2 attacks, 3 treasure rolls at +1. On each turn of the dragon, roll d6, on a 1 or 2 the dragon breathes fire, inflicting 1 life to all characters who fail to save versus level 6 dragon breath (each character adds 1⁄2 level, rounded down). If the dragon does not breathe, he bites 2 random characters. Small dragons are never met as random monsters.

Reactions (d6): 1 Sleeping (all characters can attack at +2 on their first attack), 2–3 bribe (all the gold of the party, with a minimum of 100 gold or one magic item), 4–5 fight, 6 quest.
