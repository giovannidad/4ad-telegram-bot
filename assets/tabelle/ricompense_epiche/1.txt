The Book of Skalitos. The party is given the spell book that belonged to the legendary wizard Skalitos. This counts as one scroll of each of the six spells. You may tear up the pages and distribute the six spells among the party to use as scrolls, or leave the book as it is and assign it to only one character. The book is old and fragile, and it is destroyed if the character carrying it is killed by dragon breath. If unused, the book may be sold for 650 gold pieces at the end of the adventure.
